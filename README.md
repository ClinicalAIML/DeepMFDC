# DeepMFDC
Official implementation of the paper DeepMFDC: End-to-End Adaptive-Basis Contrastive Deep Clustering for Multivariate Functional Data with an Application to Intraoperative ICU Risk Phenotyping


For example, to run the experiments for the simulation case2, you can run the code train_case2.py
The Python file will automatically generate the simulation datasets and run the experiments on each dataset.

The simulation can be found in the simulation file, and you can run the R code to generate the synthetic dataset.
